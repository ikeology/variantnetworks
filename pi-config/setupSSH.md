SSH - challenges: 
How to SSH into the Raspberry Pi -

The mobile setup is the main challenge. My thought is to flash my pi for my hotspot, that way 
no matter what you know it's able to connect to wifi, 

THEN

connect my laptop to my wifi as well and I know I'm in the pi. 





Lesson Learned: 
- it's worth being able to seamlessly SSH into the pi otherwise you run into issue like not being able to copy and paste into terminal, 
--- you'll need to upload files or folder from some program, and if you cant get into the pi, then it becomes an issue. 
--- my thought is to have a wifi source of truth which will be my iphone wifi for now.
